# Ecosystem: The Documentation

## Ecosys

\b Ecosystem is a simple grid-like map populated by various entities. An entity can have its own type, move around and 
have its set of behaviours and values. With an aim of creating an environment where these entities can interact with
each others.

## Motivation

On a random friday I had a random idea of making my own ecosystem, just like my own overengineered fish tank, but with 0s and 1s.

*That's all it took...*

What motivates me to work on this project is how I've started: with nothing but my laptop waiting for input and a coffee-filled 
brain.
